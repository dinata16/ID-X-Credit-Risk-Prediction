## Project Overview
Credit risk analysis is a crucial task in the financial sector, helping lenders and institutions assess the likelihood of loan repayment. This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to credit risk evaluation using machine learning techniques.

### Key Objectives
1. Explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
3. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict credit risk.
4. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features that are commonly used in credit risk assessment, such as:
* Demographic Information (e.g., age, gender)
* Loan Details (e.g., amount, tenure)
* Credit Behavior Metrics (e.g., payment history, defaults)

Note: Specific details about the dataset are included in the notebook.

## Notebook Contents
### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values.
* Encoding categorical variables.
* Scaling numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualizing key features and distributions.
* Identifying correlations and patterns.

### 3. Model Building
* Tried multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
* Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
* Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
* Analysis of the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance on different risk categories.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
* Summarized findings and provided business-oriented recommendations.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 97.1% and an ROC-AUC score of 99%.
Insights derived from the analysis highlight important features influencing credit risk.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:
* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
